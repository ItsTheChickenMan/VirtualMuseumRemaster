./dev/ is an example of a game folder.  game folders should contain all files pertaining to your game, and should be structured in a specific way so that the engine can find all files properly.  More info on each subdir is below:


./models/
	- path to models.  any model loaded in .world files should use a path relative to this folder (ex. if a model is in ./models/man/man.glb, the path in the world file should be ./man/man.glb)

./sounds/
	- path to audio files.  any audio file loaded in .world files should use a path relative to this folder (see ./model/ for example)


./textures/
	- path to image files for textures.  any texture loaded in .world files should use a path relative to this folder (see ./model/ for example)


./worlds/
	- path to .world files and .walkmap files.  when running the engine from the command line and passing an argument to --world, the path should be relative to this folder (ex. if the world is in ./worlds/example.world, the argument will look like "--world example.world")
