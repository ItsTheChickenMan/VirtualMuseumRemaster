# VirtualMuseumRemaster

The intent of this project is to remaster the project I completed in April of 2021.  While enjoyed by the intended audience (my history teacher), it's very flawed in numerous ways which are documented in the [README](https://github.com/ItsTheChickenMan/HistoryProject/blob/master/README.md) file of the original, and in many other ways not documented.  This project aims to improve the look and feel of the experience as well as fix bugs.  The only things I plan to keep at the moment are the original audio and maybe some textures.

Also, I realize that this is more of remake than a remaster, but I'm 3 weeks into the project at the time of writing and I don't feel like changing the name.

## Prompt

The exact prompt for the project was as follows:

" It’s the year 1968 and you’re celebrating the end of America’s involvement in some of the harsher moments during the Cold War! Looking back on your life over the past years, you realize a lot has happened! Wanting to preserve these events for future generations, you want to create a museum to curiate [*sic*] these events for future generations to appreciate and understand... "
